# computerVisionMusic

This program, which I created as a fun personal challenge, uses computer vision to make music.

When the program is run, a view of what the computer's webcam sees will be displayed on the screen. The user just needs to grab 
a bright colored marker, show it to the camera and click on it. Once that is done, the marker will act like an air drum, if
the user moves it fast, the computer will produce a drum sound.
